# Huffman Algorithm

● Implemented lossless data compression Huffman Algorithm using C++

● Used concept of trees, data structures and Algorithms to create new codes for each characters

● Built Huffman Tree providing details about encoding, decoding and frequency of characters in input text file

● Resulted compression of over 47% on sample file of size 192 KB

● Used Object Oriented Programming to create Huffman Class containing functions for traversing tree, creating codes, encoding and decoding text and tree etc.
